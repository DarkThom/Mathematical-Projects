Steven is a suit-seller in Mississippi.
Once a year, he gets rid of his unsold stock, selling separately jackets and trousers, at $10, $20, $30, $40 and $50.  

Heâ€™d like to know how much each piece of clothing is likely to yield (expected value and variance).
Steven gave his statistician friend a mission: to deduce from his past results
the probability to sell a $x jacket and $y trousers together.
