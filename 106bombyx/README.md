| **n**       | number of first generation individuals          |
| **k**       | growth rate from 1 to 4                         |
| **i0**      | initial generation (included)                   |
| **i1**      | final generation (included)                     |

In the 70’s, chaos theory opened the way for a better understanding of some animal species.
Butterflys for instance. Let’s say... bombyx.

If a generation is crowded, chances are that the next generation will be crowded too, regarding the natural rules of
reproduction. But resources may lack for this new generation, so it may not be able to develop.  
Therefore, the evolution of the number of bombyx from a generation to the next one is not trivial.
