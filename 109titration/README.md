The benzoic acid (whom molecule is hereby represented) is used in industry as a food  
preservative under the E220 code. It is a white silky-looking solid.  

To dertermine the concentration of this additive in a solution, one can realize a pH titration:  
soda is progressivly added to the solution, and pH is then read.  

There are two main approaches to do so :
-  the derivative method
-  the parallel tangents method
