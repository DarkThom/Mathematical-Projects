| **num**    | polynomial numerator defined by its coeficients   |
| **den**    | polynomial denominator defined by its coeficients |

A transfer function is here defined by two strings (one for the numerator, one for the denominator),  
composed by the polynomial coeficients split by the ’*’ sign.  
The program has to print the frequency responses of the component for the values from 0 to 1, by 0.001 steps.
