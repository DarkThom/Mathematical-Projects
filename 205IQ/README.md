Most of the reference curves were created using Gaussians, such as classical weight and height curves.  
These curves appear to correctly describe "normality", and that’s the reason why
the Gaussian distribution is also called normal distribution.

In the same vein, psychometric intelligence tests, named IQ tests, are performed so that
the results follow a normal distribution. They are calibrated to match
predetermined averages (μ) and standard deviations (σ).  

For historical reasons, the mean is always equal to 100.
Regarding standard deviation, it is most often worth 15 but could vary.
The interpretation of the resulting IQ obviously depends on the calibration of the test.
