Pong, developped as an arcade game in 1972 by Ralph Baer (Atari), is the first
ever successful video game. It was inspired by the very first video game,
Tennis for Two, developped in 1958 by William Higinbotham on an oscilloscope.

The goal of this project is to work on a 3d version of this game ;
only one bat will be considered, moving only in the 0-altitude plan (which happens to be (Oxy)).
